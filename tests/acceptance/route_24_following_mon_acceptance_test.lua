-- Production-composed contract for Route 24's Rocket cutscene program shape:
-- the follower movement mode switches to the transition mode through the
-- real script-command dispatch, a fast scripted player walk carries the
-- follower at the remembered fast pace, the follower wait observes real
-- settlement, and the mode restores to ordinary free following. Real
-- ROM-derived Route 24 map data, the real field runtime, and the real mon
-- service stay in the path; only host boundaries (audio, saves, clock) are
-- faked by the harness. The partner is stacked on the tile the probe step
-- vacates so command replay and previous-tile steering observably diverge;
-- the cutscene script bytes themselves are pinned at the ROM layer.
