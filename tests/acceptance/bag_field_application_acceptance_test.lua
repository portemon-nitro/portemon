-- Production-composed field Bag topology contract. A real field runtime
-- owns the live Bag service and cursor: the Start Menu offers the Bag route
-- once the source Bag flag is set and confirming it opens the Bag
-- application over the retained menu. This journey proves a structural
-- topology change preserves the semantic selection and that a pointer press
-- held across the change cannot activate a moved target. Browse quantities,
-- cursor memory, and action flows live in the bag actions integration
-- journey; this file keeps the distinct topology/stale-capture boundary.
-- Only host boundaries (saves, render trap) are faked; maps, scripts,
-- actors, the generated item catalog, and the save composition stay
-- production. No renderer or GPU call may occur on the journey.
