-- Starter acquisition reveals the follower through the pending transition:
-- party mutation, a pre-publication transition command through production
-- script dispatch, hidden partner publication, reveal, then one ordinary
-- player step with synchronized visible following. Real ROM-derived maps,
-- the real field runtime, and the real mon service stay in the path; only
-- host boundaries (audio, saves, clock) are faked by the harness. Party
-- setup calls the production mon service directly and the transition command
-- runs through the production script runtime handler with the live
-- following-mon and transition owners; both intentionally bypass script
-- decoding to isolate reconciliation and transition/follow integration.
-- Script decoding is exercised elsewhere. The scenario never shows the actor
-- by hand and never installs a pre-visible partner.
