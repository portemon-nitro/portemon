-- Shared staging/publication lifecycle for generated cache artifacts. A writer
-- stages every owned file under a disposable mirror (`staging/<version>/<name>/`,
-- mirroring the live cache-relative layout), validates the staged result, and
-- only then publishes it: each owned live root is moved to an adjacent next
-- sibling, each live root is moved aside, and the candidates are renamed into
-- place. A publication failure leaves the previous live artifact untouched:
-- staging never writes to the live tree, and a failed publish rolls every moved
-- root back before re-raising. Cleanup failure leaves the new artifact live and
-- its recovery metadata available. The move-aside / move-in / rollback lifecycle
-- itself is shared with whole-version publication
-- (`CacheFs.publishFromStage`); this module owns the artifact stage, the owned
-- root list, and the caller contract (no abort once publish has begun). Paths,
-- validation, and readback stay with the individual cache classes. Love-free;
-- all IO goes through the CacheFs backend.

-- crash mid-publish can never leave the new marker visible without its full
-- artifact (the marker root is moved aside and renamed into place last). Any
-- stale private stage from a previous attempt is removed first. Version-wide
-- publication recovery remains owned by CacheFs at publication boundaries.
-- The returned transaction exposes `stage` (a
-- CacheFs mirroring the live layout under the staging root), `publish()`, and
-- `abort()`.
