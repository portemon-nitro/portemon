-- FieldTransition tests freeze the project fade cadence, black-only swap,
-- input lock, completion event, and arrival suppression. Map protection is
-- owned by the runtime: the transition never pins or unpins maps, aborting a
-- failed transition never touches loader protection, and a commit fault
-- after the black-frame ownership transfer begins is fatal (no transition
-- rollback). The explicit door choreography facts (sourceKind, sourceDoor,
-- destinationDoor) determine the destination-egress predicate at its read
-- sites. The door choreography pins the
-- HGSS event order -- open-start, open-finished, player-step-start,
-- player-step-finished, close-start, close-finished -- with the fade
-- orthogonal where HGSS overlaps it: the ingress begins only after the
-- source door finished opening, the destination egress begins only after
-- the destination door finished opening, and the close begins only after
-- the egress movement finished. Door-kind warps with an unresolvable door
-- or ingress step, and egress steps without a terrain destination, are
-- data-contract failures and raise; a door-kind warp with NO door resolver
-- is a headless caller stating it has no door choreography and degrades to a
-- plain fade. Pre-commit failures abort to a coherent idle state; post-commit
-- faults propagate without pretending to roll back ownership. The warp kind is passed down
-- from the trigger record -- the transition never re-reads the permission
-- grid to classify the warp tile.
