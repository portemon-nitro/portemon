-- The one application modal owner the field session steps: it owns the
-- Start Menu controller and, while a child destination is open, the
-- foreground application controller (closed/menu/application, plus the
-- terminal failed state for factory failures), the Start Menu selection
-- remembered across a child-application round trip, the modal input
-- lifetime (beginUi once at open, clearUi once on final field return,
-- failure, or disposal), and exactly-once disposal of each owned
-- controller on success, cancellation, failure, reset, or runtime
-- disposal. The Start Menu is not an application-registry entry: the host
-- constructs it through its required menuFactory (the runtime's composition
-- step) on open and rebuild; a menuFactory result of nil means the menu is
-- currently unavailable (no interactive actions) and the open is a no-op --
-- the host stays closed and the field continues. An open whose composition
-- throws is a terminal failure: the host enters its failed phase, which owns
-- the tick, so the session must not run any later world phase that tick.
-- The host dispatches child destinations through the immutable
-- FieldApplicationRegistry and publishes them on the launch tick over the
-- retained Start Menu: the menu stays drawable while the child owns
-- semantic input, and a fresh menu is composed atomically when the child
-- closes so policy changes are reflected. The host never launches a child
-- by itself: the menu controller records { kind = "launch", applicationId }
-- results and the host dispatches them through the registry on that same
-- tick. Pointer events reach the menu wrapper unmapped: the wrapper owns
-- its presentation session and maps host coordinates itself, so the host
-- never holds a placement record and never drops scroll events on the
-- menu's behalf. Pure module: no love, no I/O.
