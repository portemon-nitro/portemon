-- MapProps: the door/model lookup facade. A scene's map props resolve a
-- field coordinate to the door of the building placed there -- field
-- coordinate -> building placement -> ModelInstance -> semantic door
-- animation -- with the doorway API gameplay uses:
--
--     door = mapProps:doorAt(runtimeMap, x, z)
--     door:open()
--     door:close()
--     door:isFinished()
--
-- Door ownership is precomputed once when the scene is assembled: the
-- assembly enumerates the DOOR-kind (behavior 105) tiles of the permission
-- cell (DoorTiles.fromGrid, local indices 0..31) and resolves each to the
-- placement whose pivot (the transform translation, [13]/[15]) is NEAREST
-- the tile centre -- the predicate verified against the real ROM, where
-- door models are planar slabs whose model-space AABB does not contain the
-- tile centre (New Bark member 26: x[-0.3,0.0] z[0.0,0.0]) and a containment
-- test resolves the wrong static building. A geometric tie (every placement
-- within DOOR_TIE_EPSILON_SQ of the global best distance) is resolved by the
-- generated door semantics already carried on each placement record
-- (`doorSoundType`, `doorRoles`, see ModelDoorMetadata): one semantic owner
-- wins, no semantic owner resolves a static door with no placement owner,
-- and several semantic owners stay a diagnosable ambiguity. The nearest
-- pivot decides ownership only within MAX_DOOR_PIVOT_DISTANCE_TILES (corpus-backed: a
-- real-ROM census over every door map found each door tile's nearest pivot
-- within the bound); a tile beyond it is diagnosed once at assembly as
-- uncovered, like a tile with no placement at all. doorAt is then an O(1)
-- index lookup: no placement scan, no matrix inversion, no epsilon on the
-- hot path. The index is authoritative: a tile it does not cover resolves
-- nil, and mutating the placement list after assembly changes nothing.
-- Ambiguity (several placements with door semantics tied for one door
-- tile) and missing coverage (a
-- door tile with no placement at all, or none within the bound) are data
-- failures diagnosed once at assembly, not per lookup. A geometric tie with
-- no door-semantic candidate is a valid static door, not a failure. Only DOOR-kind warp tiles resolve; stairs, directional warps, and
-- generic warps return nil (their choreography is separate policy). A door
-- whose building is static (no animated instance) resolves but animates
-- nothing -- HGSS's interior doors without animation records behave the
-- same. Pure domain module.
--
-- The playback surface is the collapsed animation object graph:
-- MapProps carries no controller. MapDoor plays through the instance and
-- retains the returned play handle on the tile's index entry
-- (entry.animation); isFinished reads that handle, so the finish state never
-- depends on the disposable MapDoor identity. SceneProp keeps exactly
-- play/stop/isFinished -- pause/resume/setDirection/animationsFor have no
-- production caller and do not exist.
--
-- Door sound identity and role duration are generated data, carried on each
-- placement record (`doorSoundType`, `doorRoles`) by whoever builds the
-- placements array (FieldMapLoader reads them from the model descriptor
-- cache -- see ModelDoorMetadata -- so both a headless and a presentation
-- MapProps over the same generated data agree). A door with no live
-- ModelInstance is not thereby "static": when the generated data carries a
-- role duration for it, MapDoor plays a semantic-only timer (retained on the
-- same entry.animation slot, advanced once per tick by MapProps:updateFixed,
-- the deterministic engine clock) that reaches completion at the same source
-- frame a presentation ModelInstance would. Only a role with NO generated
-- duration and no live instance is immediate/nothing-to-wait-for (nil),
-- matching HGSS's genuinely unanimated interior doors.
--
-- Production constructs exactly one MapProps per runtime map (FieldMapLoader
-- builds it before the scene loader runs); a presentation load attaches its
-- live ModelInstances into that SAME instance (MapProps:attachInstances)
-- rather than constructing a second one, so headless and presentation always
-- read the one retained per-tile playback slot -- there is no cross-instance
-- census to keep in sync.
