-- Script interaction client : the construction
-- point that replaced the pre-script interaction adapter. It resolves an
-- immutable InteractionIntent through the bindings manifest into a trigger
-- descriptor, composes the bound script, and starts it as the foreground
-- root through the scheduler so a newly resolved interaction may execute
-- during its trigger tick. The binding audit at load time guarantees every
-- interactable event is bound, so an unmapped intent reaching this client is
-- a composition fault (the session asserts on it) — there is no fallback.
-- Pure domain module: no love dependency.
