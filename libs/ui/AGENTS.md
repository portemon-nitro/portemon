# libs/ui Agent Guidance

This package owns the narrow game-independent widget primitives:

- `Button` — generic layered rounded-rectangle geometry and hit-test.
- `TextButton` and `ImageButton` — composition over `Button`.
- `LayoutGeometry` — generic rectangle/fit/host↔logical geometry (copied rects, containment, overlap, inset, centered uniform fit, host/logical transforms). Semantic game layouts stay consumers and keep their own placement policy.
- `PixelScale` owns integer presentation policy: preferred integer scale selection, ceil-covered logical allocations, and logical-pixel snapping. Generic rectangle validation, fit geometry, placement records, and host↔logical transforms belong to `LayoutGeometry`. `PixelScale` composes `LayoutGeometry`; it must not reproduce or wrap its generic public APIs.
- `LogicalSurface` owns stateless execution of one logical coordinate boundary: `draw` applies a resolved placement (single root transform with intersected clipping) and `clip` scopes a logical subregion, both restoring borrowed graphics state even on callback failure. It allocates no GPU objects, retains no state, and knows no application, topology, or device.
- `FocusGraph` owns stateless ordered directional candidate resolution (`FocusGraph.move`) and stateless reconciliation across explicit replacement graphs (`FocusGraph.reconcile`). Graph construction, current focus state, wrap policy, enabled state, pointer behavior, history, layout, and rendering remain consumer-owned.
- `ScreenTopology` describes host display capabilities and surfaces. `DisplayContext` measures
  drawable and topology facts. `ApplicationLayout` resolves shared placement and frame
  geometry, and `ApplicationPresentation` owns publication of a resolved presentation plan.
  These mechanisms do not own feature-specific semantic layouts or retail application policy.

## Ownership

- No first-party production dependencies. Game and asset state stays in consumers.
- Widgets receive an injected LÖVE-like graphics object (`setColor`, `rectangle`, plus transform/line stack for TextButton) and caller-owned color/content adapters. They never read global `love`, own GPU resources, or require `game`, `libs/hgss`, `libs/assets`, or `romdump`.
- Resolved geometry is a caller-owned snapshot; widgets retain no state, resources, or semantic selection/navigation between calls.

## Boundaries

- Generic widgets, display facts, and shared presentation behavior belong here. HGSS-specific
  dialogue, field-menu, font, or source-aware UI stays in `libs/hgss/src/ui`. Semantic retail
  layouts and interfaces remain in their feature consumers and keep their own placement policy.
- Every new shared abstraction needs a concrete current consumer in the repository. A single caller is evidence to keep code local.

## Verification

- `scripts/test.sh --filter "libs.ui.tests"` proves the family.
- `tests/architecture/module_boundaries_test.lua` enforces the leaf package and allowed consumers.
