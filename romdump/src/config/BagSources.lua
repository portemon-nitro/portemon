-- Producer-side semantic inventory of the field-bag presentation sources:
-- NARC 15 member selection, canonical geometry, hero model/animation
-- selection, and normalized presentation facts. The audit basis is
-- pret/pokeheartgold@0985e8718df4f25e64d6507d89c0c97c0d288981
-- asm/overlay_15.s (the field-bag application; Bag_Init opens NARC 15 and
-- every member below is loaded by an audited call site), plus
-- include/camera.h, include/sprite_system.h, include/bg_window.h, and
-- include/text.h for the called-API signatures. The TM/HM summary facts
-- below are audited against asm/unk_02077678.s at the same pin: the table
-- at _02100048 carries the type char members in its first 18 entries
-- (indexed by sub_02077678), the table at _021000A4 carries the 18 type
-- palette overrides (indexed by sub_0207769C), the table at _0210003C
-- carries {0xF4, 0xF6, 0xF5} as the category char members (indexed by
-- sub_02077800), and the table at _02100038 carries {0, 1, 0} as the
-- category palette overrides (indexed by sub_02077818); the shared
-- palette/cell/animation members and the NARC 8 archive identity come
-- from the sub_02077690, sub_02077694, sub_02077698, and sub_020776B4
-- selectors. Resource kinds and source compression state for the reviewed
-- members come from files/data/resdat/resdat_00000024.json (animation
-- member 243, compressed), resdat_00000025.json (cell member 242,
-- compressed), resdat_00000026.json (char member 234, compressed), and
-- resdat_00000055.json (palette member 74, uncompressed). Pure data and pure
-- functions; no I/O. Never imported by runtime: libs/assets, game, and
-- script packages must not require this module.
--
-- Audited member selection (NARC 15 = bag_ui; all member identities are
-- zero-based):
--
-- 2D backgrounds: char 7 + screens 9/54/93/94 (upper pane; 93 is the female
-- backdrop and 94 the male backdrop, selected by the gender byte; 54 and 9
-- are the mode-swapped description frame screens) and char 46 + screens
-- 39/42/43/44/45/52/53 (lower pane; 43+39 browse variant 0, 44+42 move
-- variant 1, retained browse BG5 + 45 action variant 2, retained action
-- BG5 + 52 quantity variant 3, 53 the unused alternate quantity screen).
-- The variant selection lives in ov15_021FD574: case 0 loads 43 on BG5 and
-- 39 on BG6, case 1 loads 44 on BG5 with the ov15_021FD4C0 mutation and 42
-- on BG6, case 2 retains BG5 with the ov15_021FD43C count mutation and
-- loads 45 on BG6, case 3 retains BG5 and loads 52 on BG6. Raster palettes 8 (upper) and 41 (lower)
-- reproduce the retail layer colors; the lower palette below is the member
-- the retail pocket switch selects (decoded GetPlttData slot 1), and the
-- text-layer GetPlttData slot selections stay producer-side.
--
-- Sprites: the 39-entry ManagedSpriteTemplate table at ov15_02200B0C binds
-- the live bag resource groups. Tabs use char 51 + palette 47 + cell 49 +
-- anim 50: template entries 9..16 carry the eight pocket tabs at centers
-- 16+32k, y 16 with animation and palette slot equal to the pocket index,
-- and entry 19 carries the unselected Cancel face at (224, 176) with
-- animation 16 and palette slot 8. The movable focus sprite is template
-- entry 20 (animation 8, palette slot 9 at creation); ov15_021FFECC drives
-- that single sprite through the 21-record position/state table at
-- ov15_02200AB8, applying one record's X, Y, animation, and palette
-- override per call (records 0..7 tab targets, 8..13 item targets, 14..15
-- the lower-left pair, 16 Cancel, 17..20 action targets). The item-row loop
-- at ov15_02200140 instead positions template entries 1..6 -- the six item
-- icon sprites whose per-slot char/palette tags ov15_021FF8F0 rebinds to the
-- item graphics -- at their own template X/Y centers (22/152,
-- 59/100/139); those placements never pass through the focus table.
-- The tab strip additionally depends on the retained palette member 48:
-- ov15_02200030 replays two OBJ bank copies per active pocket over the base
-- member-47 realization (see BagSources.tabPaletteState), so the persistent
-- selected-pocket treatment is palette state, not the movable focus sprite.
-- Entries 28..31 sit at the four action-button centers with animation 22;
-- entries 32..37 are the quantity-screen widgets driven with the tables at
-- ov15_02200A58 and ov15_02200A88; the remaining entries are auxiliary
-- states. Item icons resolve through archive 18
-- (GetItemIndexMapping/GetItemIconCell/GetItemIconAnim) and are never
-- compiled here. NANR 21 loads with no static template binding and is
-- recorded but not compiled.
--
-- The top strip (template entry 0: char 26 + palette 15 + cell 25 +
-- anim 24, sprite center (177, 14)) is intentionally uncompiled: the
-- creation path hides sprite index 0 and no audited SetDrawFlag(1) path
-- re-enables it, so it has no visible state.
--
-- Hero 3D: the model init selects by the gender byte (0 is male): model 55
-- with pattern members 57-64, joint members 65-72, and material member 73,
-- or model 74 with pattern members 76-83, joint members 84-91, and material
-- member 92. The first pattern member of each group (56/75) is never read.
-- The active state slot is the selected pocket 0..7 (compared against 8,
-- wrapped modulo 8, and switched on pocket change), so each state pairs one
-- pattern clip with one joint clip plus the shared material clip.
--
-- Geometry: window tiles convert at 8 pixels per tile. Item slots pair the
-- six touch bounds at ov15_02200684 with the six 88x32 window rectangles
-- from the twelve-entry window table at ov15_02200908 (two layers sharing
-- six grid positions); tab rects tile the top strip row; icon centers are
-- the six item-icon template placements (entries 1..6, positioned by the
-- item-row loop), never the focus table's item targets; the cursor anchor
-- from the sprite position update (y 177, x stepping 16 from 16); the count readout and
-- Cancel windows from the lower-screen window setup; the description window
-- and its text origin from the upper-screen window setup and the
-- description printer; action buttons and quantity digits from their window
-- tables. The upper pane carries the hero and description; the lower pane
-- carries tabs, slots, and affordances.
--
-- Presentation: the per-frame camera copies target (0,0,0), distance
-- 0x153B51, and the angle block (x 0xE982, y 0x1420) from static tables;
-- perspective type/angle and clip planes (near 0x7B000, far 0x6A4000) are
-- static. The global material registers are the setup immediates:
-- NNS_G3dGlbMaterialColorDiffAmb(0x3DEF, 0x294A, FALSE) and
-- NNS_G3dGlbMaterialColorSpecEmi(0x3DEF, 0x3DEF, FALSE), so diffuse,
-- specular, and emission are mid-gray 15 and ambient is gray 10 rather
-- than white/zero. The model init additionally forces the material
-- ambient onto the global register (ModifyMatFlag FALSE/AMBIENT) while
-- diffuse, specular, and emission stay per-material.
--
-- Action text: msg_0010.gmm supplies the toss/move/register/unregister/cancel/
-- confirm labels and the move/toss prompt templates. The compiler lowers the
-- token streams to semantic labels and text/item/quantity template segments.
--
-- Registration markers: Bag UI character member 37 holds the 104x16 source
-- bitmap; slot 1 copies source X 24 and slot 2 copies source X 64 (Y 0,
-- 40x16 each), placed slot-locally at offset (0, 16). The hero draws with identity rotation, unit scale, translation
-- (0,-45,0), and four white lights all pointing down positive x: the hero
-- init loops four times over NNS_G3dGlbLightVector(i, 0x1000, 0, 0) with
-- NNS_G3dGlbLightColor(i, 0x7FFF), so every light carries unit vector
-- (1, 0, 0) in manifest float domain (0x1000 is 1.0 fixed-point) and white
-- color (31, 31, 31).
