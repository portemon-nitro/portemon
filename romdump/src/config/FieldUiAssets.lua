-- Source-only member selection for the generated HGSS field-UI class. Every
-- NARC alias/member number lives here and in the dependencies/provenance
-- records; the generated manifest never carries them. Member numbers are
-- zero-based per the repository convention. The signpost source-type domain
-- is exactly {0,1,2,3}: `LoadMapSignpostFrameAndGraphic` (asm/render_window.s
-- at the pinned decomp commit) always reads NARC 0x24 member 1 and selects
-- palette bank `type * 0x20`, with no alternate palette source for any other
-- type value; `tests/rom/script_corpus_test.lua`'s "signpost contracts hold
-- on the real corpus" case decodes every DirectionSignpost/SetSignpostMap
-- instruction (opcodes 55/56) in the real scr_seq corpus and pins this exact
-- domain, so a future corpus change that introduces a new type value fails
-- loudly there instead of silently widening this list. Type 0 and 1
-- additionally load the map-specific wayfinding graphic (the `type > 1`
-- branch skips it); the wayfinding member is map + 0x21 for type 0 and
-- map + 2 for type 1, over the corpus-audited map ranges. Start Menu members
-- follow src/start_menu.c and overlay 27 at pret/pokeheartgold
-- 008257708bd41df5b8c9037e019088ba24df0a87: the MAIN BG triple (char 12,
-- screen 13, palette 15) carries only the bottom-panel chrome, the SUB set
-- (char 8, screen 9, palette 7) sits behind the entry windows, the eleven
-- 20-tile icon chars with the shared cell/anim banks (16/17) and OBJ palette
-- image (14) supply the entry sprites, and cursor char/palette/cell/anim are
-- 64/61/62/63. The icon rows, context rows, action-to-icon map, sprite
-- bases, and label windows below transcribe the overlay-27 icon/context
-- mapping and sprite-base/window tables; the per-icon cell/anim members
-- (19/20...) have no traced consumer and are not selected. Dialogue frames follow
-- LoadUserFrameGfx2 (member = frame + 2, palette = frame + 0x1A), Trainer
-- Card members src/overlay_trainer_card_main.s. No sound archive is
-- selected: the branch does not reproduce the source Start Menu effects. Normal naming chrome
-- follows src/naming_screen.c at pret/pokeheartgold
-- 008257708bd41df5b8c9037e019088ba24df0a87: the normal player/Pokemon path
-- loads the full 256x192 base screen 4 on the main base layer and switches
-- the keyboard layer through `pageNum + 6`, cycling page numbers 0..2, so
-- the normal pages are screens 6 (Upper), 7 (Lower), and 8 (Symbols).
-- Screen 9 belongs to the special numpad path and stays outside this
-- contract, as do the unmapped members 5, 17, and 18. Palette 0 is the main
-- BG palette and char 2 the shared background character bank. The keyboard
-- layers sit at y=-80 in the 192-high BG coordinate system, so the visible
-- 112-high page content belongs at canonical y=80 over the base. The normal
-- OBJ stack is char 10, palette 1 (nine 16-color banks selected per OAM
-- object), NCER 12, and NANR 14. The semantic animation/anchor table below
-- transcribes src/naming_screen.c `sUISpritesParam`, the home-row cursor
-- tables, the entry-slot/subject creation, and the keyboard window geometry:
-- page controls use anims 3/8/13 (selected 0/5/10), Back/OK use 23/25
-- (selected 24/26), the support backing uses 37, the keyboard cursor uses 39
-- with home variants 40 (page controls) and 41 (Back/OK), entry slots use 43
-- (selected 44), and the player subjects use 48/49. The fourth page slot
-- (sprite 3 at y=200, sprite 4 hidden) serves the special paths and stays
-- outside the normal contract. Entered-name glyphs start at (80,24) advancing
-- 12px; entry slots start at (80,39) stepping 12px; keyboard text cells are
-- 16px columns on 19px rows from the page-art origin; the keyboard cursor
-- steps 16px by 19px from (26,91); the player subject anchors at (24,8).
